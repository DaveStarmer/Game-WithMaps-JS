# Game-With Maps-Js
This was inspired by translating the [Haunted House Game](https://github.com/DaveStarmer/Game-FromBook-Js)

The original BBC BASIC code wasn't mine, but after translating it I felt inspired to 
write something using at least vague OOP prinicples, and something which would
in turn be a bit more adaptable. This is that project.
